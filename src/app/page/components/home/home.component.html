                <p>Greetings, I am Heng, from Koh Kong Province. I hold a bachelor's degree in Web Programming
                    from the University of Puthisastra. I work as a System Development Supervisor in a private company
                    based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I firmly believe in treating everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or
                    social status. Time management is a priority for me, and I'm committed to continuous learning and
                    staying updated in my field. I enjoy music, movies, exercise, and writing during my free time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I express my immense gratitude to Passerelles Numeriques Cambodia for providing me with a
                    100% scholarship and outstanding career opportunities. This organization empowers underprivileged
                    students in remote areas to pursue higher education, and I feel privileged to have been a part of
                    their inspiring initiative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're interested in collaborating, please feel free to contact me.
                    <br>
                    Best regards, <br>
                    Heng LOEM
