                <p>I embarked on my journey as a web developer in 2017, and over the years, I've
                    cultivated a strong professional background in web development, design, and security. I thrive on
                    collaboration, maintain a structured and organized approach to my work, and excel in
                    problem-solving. My passion for development drives me to continually enhance my skills throughout
                    the development process, ensuring that the solutions I create are modern, user-friendly, robust, and
                    secure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm actively involved in open-source development and have shared my insights through professional
                    articles on various platforms like my website, Google Local Guide, LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, and Blogger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My expertise lies in creating engaging experiences with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While I enjoy
                    exploring new technologies, I specialize in Angular, Java Spring Boot, and MS SQL Server.

                <p>
                    In my free time, I have a few hobbies, including motorbike riding, working out, music appreciation,
                    Donghau, and gaming.
